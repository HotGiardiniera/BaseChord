This project implements the [Chord algorithm](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf) for P2P file systems (with the proper changes noted in [Zave, 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06461.pdf) that make the algorithm correct).

In addition to the baseline algorithm implementation, two enhancements, detailed below, are also implemented.
